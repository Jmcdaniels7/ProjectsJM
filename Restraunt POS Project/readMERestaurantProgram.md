A Restraunt POS system full developed by myself using Funtional programming in C++.
Once the program has compiled and ran, you will be prompted with a menu of options.
This menu is designed to be used in the point-of-view of a restaurant employee.
While interacting with the program use single key keyboard responses, for example (y,1,n,5,c).
While choosing reseravtions, tables, orders, food, and tables with bills to pay, use single key responses that coresponsed to the numbering of the options listed.
Finally, the restaurant has a maximum number of seats, tables, reservations, orders, and food options, so keep that in mind while entering information.
Thank you for taking a look at my project and I hope you enjoy the program.
