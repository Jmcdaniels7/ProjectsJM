<h2>My BJJ Journey</h2>



<font color="white">Jiu Jitsu is a self-defense and combat sport that I love to do during my time aside from college.
</br>
I started my BJJ journey about 3 months ago, alongside boxing and Muay Thai( a Thailand oriented 
</br>
kickboxing/boxing). I have found something that has given me confidence and a humble mentality.
</br>
I haven't had anything else give me what BJJ has given me so far and I have only been training.
</br>
for 3 months. I have only just begun to learn a small amount of what this martial art has to offer
</br>
and I a eager to learn more everytime I go to a class session.</font>


<h2>What is special about BJJ</h2>
</p>
 <font color="white">I would recommend this sport/self-defense martial art to anyone who may simply 
</br>
want to get a good workout or be the next MMA/IBBJF world champion. The sport is said to be 
</br>
designed so that the smaller man/woman can win in a self-defense situation. That is also what
</br>
gained my attention because I am not a giant human being and most people are not as well.
</br>
This is what makes this martial art special because it is designed for technique to beat 
</br>
strength in close-quarters combat. There are not any martial arts that are similar to 
</br>
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and that is what makes it special.
</br>

If you would like to try BJJ for the first time here is a couple places I recommend.</font>
